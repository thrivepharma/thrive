    We understand that our recruitment services play a crucial role in the development and success of our clients. We therefore place the utmost importance on understanding the needs of the organisation and the requirements of the situation.

    {title: 'MIDDLE MANAGEMENT',
    desc: `Middle Management represents the actual backbone of a successful organisation. Get this wrong and organisations face a lifetime trying to react to market changes, thus ultimately dying out. An effective CEO, in order to maximise their or their company’s performance has to creatively, aggressively, and systematically build the capabilities of the company’s middle management team.

    This is important for two reasons: First, virtually all major strategic initiatives have to be carried out by the middle managers. Their flexibility and leadership skills will determine how able they are to tailor and adapt initiatives to the company’s changing circumstances. Second, a strong middle management team will produce outstanding operational results, easing the need for top managers to oversee and intervene directly in day-to-day operations. A well-functioning middle management team also will proactively create a constant stream of new initiatives to remedy problems and seize new opportunities. Middle management excellence is the key leverage point for great performance.
    
    Therefore if one looked carefully at the great companies of our day, like GE for example, middle management excellence is in fact one of top management’s very highest priorities. Even after GE managers leave the company, they most often have the “look and feel” of GE’s management team: a focus on systematically teaching their subordinates to analyse and improve the businesses, and on teaching them to pass this skill on to their own management teams.
    
    Winfort has strong expertise in helping clients within our focused sectors in building this layer of strong talent. For more information on our middle management search services, please reach out to us and let’s explore how we may be of help.`,
